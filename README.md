## My MLSA Event Website

This website was built me by and my friend @Onihani contributed some code.

The project is meant to highlight my Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors event I've hosted and also contributed to.

This project is solely my idea and built the landing page and layout together with the responsiviness on small screens. 
Though therre are more work to be done on screens such as tablet screens I will continue to update this project and make it a source of inpiration for new student ambassadors who want to build something link like this.
